# EasyWorship to ProPresenter Converter

A Windows desktop application that converts songs from EasyWorship 6.1 database format to ProPresenter 6 format with full support for Swedish and English text.

## ðŸŽ‰ Current Version: v1.2.5

The converter successfully exports songs from EasyWorship to ProPresenter 6 format with advanced formatting controls and customization options.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- âœ… Read songs from EasyWorship 6.1 SQLite databases (Songs.db & SongWords.db)
- âœ… Export to ProPresenter 6 XML format (.pro6)
- âœ… Full Swedish character support (Ã¥, Ã¤, Ã¶)
- âœ… Automatic section detection (Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc.)
- âœ… Configurable Swedish to English section name mapping
- âœ… RTF text parsing with Unicode support
- âœ… Real-time search filtering across all song fields
- âœ… Custom font selection from all Windows system fonts
- âœ… Configurable slide formatting and line breaks
- âœ… Duplicate file detection and handling
- âœ… Complete settings persistence

### Using Section Mappings

Access the Section Mappings settings from the Edit menu to:
- Customize how Swedish section names are translated to English
- Add new language mappings
- Import/export mapping configurations
- Test translations with the preview feature

### Export Options

Access Export Options from the Edit menu to configure:
- **Font Settings**: Choose from all available Windows fonts and set custom font size
- **Line Breaking**: Control how lyrics are split across slides
- **File Naming**: Include CCLI number or author in filenames
- **Duplicate Handling**: Choose to skip, overwrite, or rename duplicates

#### Line Breaking and Slide Formatting

The "Automatically break long lines" setting controls how content is divided into slides:

**How it works:**
1. **Natural Slide Breaks**: Empty lines in the lyrics always create new slides
2. **Maximum Lines Per Slide**: Set how many lines appear on each slide (default: 4)

**When "Automatically break long lines" is ON:**
- Slides with more lines than the maximum are automatically split
- Example: An 8-line verse with max=4 creates 2 slides (4 lines each)

**When "Automatically break long lines" is OFF:**
- Natural slides are kept intact regardless of line count
- Only empty lines create new slides
- Example: An 8-line verse stays as 1 slide with all 8 lines

### Search Features

The search bar allows you to:
- Filter songs by title, author, copyright, or CCLI number
- View search history (last 10 searches)
- See filtered results count
- Clear search with one click
